            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h3>Choose a Journal</h3>

        <h3> Writer's Block</h3>
       <!-- Mini Para 1-->
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> You may come across writer's block, where you suddenly get a mind blank and you just stare at your entry unsure of what to write. 
            In order to get over that, change of scenery might help you think of something. Maybe listening to music might help. Maybe you might need to use prompts.
            You can also make a routine so your brain can automatically responsive to making ideas in writing during those periods.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Heading-->
        <h3> Privacy</h3>
        <!-- Mini Para 2-->
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> Especially when you share livings spaces with others, if you think that you have to worry about your privacy getting leaked out to those around you then here are some tips.
            Try to find a nice and secure locations where you can hide your journal like a personal drawer. Online journals are more recommended if you're worried about some finding your journal. 
        Try using an app which enables a passcode to keep your journal entries safe. </p>
      
        <!-- Heading-->
        <h3> Not enough time</h3>
       <!-- Mini Para 3-->
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> If you fear that you do not have enough time to write your thoughts in a journal then worry not, there are still options that can still work out for you.
        You can write once a week rather than daily and write in bullet points rather than long sentences. Use a gratitude journal, it wouldn't ask too much from you other than the things you feel gratitude for.</p>
     
        <!-- Heading-->
        <h3> Not liking a journalling method</h3>
       <!-- Mini Para 4-->
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> There are so many ways to journal. If you feel that writing sentences does not resonate with you then try using a different journalling method.
        You can draw pictures illustrating your day instead or write events in bullet points.</p>
      
        <!-- Heading-->
        <h3> Feeling like that you're bad at journalling</h3>
       <!-- Mini Para 5-->
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> You're not! Believe me. Sometimes thoughts like these can be really demotivating, don't be embarassed if you feel like that you're missing something.
        Journalling is not perfect, it will just flow out of your mind how you desire it. If you have days that you have nothing you can think of writing about, come back another time!
    Be kind to yourself and practice self love.</p>
