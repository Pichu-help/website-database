    <h1>Basic Introduction</h1>
                            
    <p style="font-size:130%;"> For me, I'm very passionate about <strong> journalling </strong>. I think of it as an act of self care. 
        If you do not know what it is then here is the basic definition on what it is.</p>

        <p style="font-size:130%;"> As you can see, journalling is a practice of writing down your own thoughts and feelings to understand yourself clearly. 
            Especially if you are struggling with mental health, keeping a journal might be a good idea. 
            Even so, it does not need to only contain your worries or dark secrets, you can also write down goals that you may want to achieve.
